                	<h1><span class="green">></span>Why The Internet is an Amazing Place<span class="green">.</span></h1>
                    <p>Growing up I have always had a massive interest in everything about the internet. In today's world that isn't too uncommon, however every once in a while I will run into someone just like me. They have the same passion and interest in the abilities and potential of the internet. With that passion and potential those poeple will often create or discover new things by learning as much as they possibly can.</p>
                    <p>Now not everyone is like that, most people just use the internet to blankly process massive amounts of useless information. But why do people do this? Imagine having a massive library of information available to access whenever you were near a computer or smart phone; for a majority of people in developed countries this is the reality. Why wouldn't you take every chance you can get to learn something new? The amount of useful information available to you on the internet is bottomless. More information is being added to the internet every single second of every single day, so much so that you cannot keep up with it even if you dedicated your life to doing just that.</p>
                    <p>Going through public school I didn't have ANY opurtunities to further myself as a developer, designer, or photographer. It wasn't until my Senior year of High School that a internship program in the arts became available to me. In that internship program I learned how to use Illustrator fluently, screen print, and design infinitely repeating patterns using real world images and designs. But in reality none of that helped me at all. The only valuable skill I gained was the ability to use Illustrator. So in that 9 month internship I learned 3 skills; only one of which was helpful to me.</p>
                    <p>While the experience you gain through internships is more often than not completely invaluable a large portion of your time is always wasted with them. When I made that realization I decided to move my learning to the internet. Before this moment I was already using the internet to learn how to program in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and (most importantly) Python. But after that moment I started to take everything about what I had done very seriously. I started to make programs and do research in my own time, no longer for fun but with the goal to further myself as a programmer and eventually get a job doing something I love.</p>
                    <p>This is the portion of the internet that people don't realize exists. It isn't just a place for you to talk to friends or read up on gossip or even discover new bloggers. It is in its raw essence a place to share, develop, and research information with the entire world. It is the most invaluable, misunderstood, and most misuesed tool that the human race has ever used. Once you come to realize this the internet stops becoming that place to read gossip and look at pictures of cats and it becomes more of a place of endless discovery and knowledge that literally sits at your finger tips. It becomes a place that is completely capable of changing your life if you use it correctly and if you ask me, that is just amazing.</p>
